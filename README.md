Property and real estate investment

Rule #1: Location location location.

Rule #2: Buy right, refinance, and buy more.

**Note:** You can refinance to a higher value, pull out some money to invest more once your asset grows.

**Note:** You need to know the rules for refinance, too.

Rule #3: Some mortgage lenders will cap you at a certain number of properties.

**Note:** You should double check the terms and conditions with your mortgage broker.

Rule #4: ~50% of the investment profit will be counted as the income. Then, the tax will be calculated from the income.

**Note:** If you decided to move in to an investment property and make it as the principal residence, make sure you do get an market value and property assessment from a licensed appraiser (not the assessment from government). Otherwise, CRA may use any number they preferred to count the amount for tax.
